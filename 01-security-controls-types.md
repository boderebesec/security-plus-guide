## What Are Security Controls?

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures used to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets.

They are classified in two primary ways:

---

## Security Control Categories

Describes how the control is implemented:

| Category       | Definition                           | Examples                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Administrative | Policies and procedures (management) | Security policies, user training, SOPs  |
| Technical      | Technology-based protections         | Firewalls, encryption, access control lists |
| Physical       | Tangible barriers or protection      | Locks, guards, fences, CCTV             |

## Security Control Types

Describes what the control is intended to achieve:

| Type         | Purpose                              | Examples                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Preventive   | Stop incidents before they occur     | Firewalls, MFA, security awareness training  |
| Detective    | Identify incidents during or after   | IDS, audit logs, CCTV                        |
| Corrective   | Restore systems after an incident    | Patching, backups, system restores           |
| Deterrent    | Discourage malicious behavior        | Warning signs, security guards, monitoring signs |
| Recovery     | Restore availability post-incident   | Backup systems, disaster recovery plans      |
| Compensating | When primary control is not feasible | Additional monitoring in lieu of MFA         |
| Directive    | Direct behavior or define actions    | Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), mandatory training |

## Key Concepts

- Controls can belong to multiple categories and types.
- Example: CCTV is Physical (category) and both Detective & Deterrent (types).
- Directive controls are crucial for governance and policy enforcement.
