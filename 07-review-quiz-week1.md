## Domain 1 Overview — What You Need to Know

| Concept                   | Must-Know Points                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CIA Triad                 | Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability — the backbone of all security decisions               |
| AAA Framework             | Authentication, Authorization, Accounting — user validation and tracking                        |
| Security Controls         | Categories (Administrative, Technical, Physical) vs. Types (Preventive, Detective, Directive)   |
| Zero Trust                | Never trust, always verify — identity and context at every access request                       |
| Encryption                | Symmetric vs. Asymmetric, key management, common algorithms                                     |
| Hashing                   | Integrity verification, one-way functions — SHA-256 is your go-to                                |
| Obfuscation               | Defense-in-depth technique to delay or confuse attackers                                         |
| Authentication Models     | DAC, MAC, RBAC, ABAC — critical for access control scenarios                                    |
| Certificates & PKI        | Role of CAs, digital signatures, public key infrastructure basics                               |

## Flashcard Review (Key Questions)

1. **What are the three core categories of security controls?**  
   Administrative, Technical, Physical

2. **Which type of control detects events after they occur?**  
   Detective control

3. **What’s the difference between hashing and encryption?**  
   Hashing is one-way and ensures integrity; encryption is reversible and protects confidentiality

4. **In asymmetric encryption, which key is used to encrypt?**  
   The recipient’s public key

5. **What is the main goal of Zero Trust architecture?**  
   Enforce least privilege and continuously verify access requests

6. **Give an example of a compensating control.**  
   Manual log review in place of automated monitoring

7. **What makes ABAC more dynamic than RBAC?**  
   ABAC evaluates attributes (e.g., time, location), not just roles

## Tips for Practice

- Repetition: use flashcards daily to reinforce acronyms and key terms  
- Apply in scenarios: map concepts to real-world tasks or workplace examples  
- Read exam questions carefully: look for qualifiers like “best,” “first,” or “most effective”
