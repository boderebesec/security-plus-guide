## Topic: Threat Actors & Attack Vectors

**Domain**: 2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations

## Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups that intentionally exploit vulnerabilities. They vary by **motivation**, **capability**, **resources**, and **risk tolerance**.

### Common Threat Actor Types

- **Script Kiddies**  
  Inexperienced attackers using off-the-shelf tools.  
  - Motivation: Curiosity or reputation  
  - Risk: Low skill but still dangerous via automated exploits

- **Hacktivists**  
  Ideologically or politically motivated.  
  - Motivation: Protest or cause disruption  

- **Organized Crime**  
  Well-funded criminal groups.  
  - Motivation: Financial gain  
  - Tools: Ransomware, phishing, extortion

- **Nation-State Actors (APTs)**  
  State-sponsored, highly advanced.  
  - Motivation: Espionage, disruption, warfare  
  - Methods: Zero-day exploits, long-term stealth campaigns

- **Insiders**  
  Employees, contractors or third parties with legitimate access.  
  - Types: Malicious (intentional) or negligent (accidental)

- **Competitors**  
  Seeking trade secrets or to sabotage operations.

## Threat Actor Attributes

Actors can be further classified by:

- **Sophistication** – Unskilled to APT-level  
- **Resources** – Custom malware, zero-days, toolkits  
- **Motivation** – Money, ideology, espionage  
- **Preferred vectors** – Based on access level & goals

## Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are the paths or means by which threat actors gain access to systems.

### Common Attack Vectors

- **Email / Phishing**  
  Malicious links or attachments that steal credentials or drop malware.

- **Social Engineering**  
  Manipulation (pretexting, baiting, tailgating) to extract info or access.

- **Removable Media**  
  USB drives used to introduce malware or exfiltrate data.

- **Wireless & Bluetooth**  
  Evil-twin APs, protocol exploits, weak encryption.

- **Public-Facing Applications**  
  Web apps or APIs vulnerable to injection, misconfiguration, unpatched flaws.

- **Supply Chain**  
  Compromised hardware/software or tainted third-party services.

- **Cloud Services**  
  Misconfigured buckets, weak credentials, missing MFA.

- **Drive-By Downloads**  
  Hidden malware downloads on compromised websites.

- **Physical Access**  
  Direct device access for data theft or rogue device installation.

## Reinforcement Notes

- **Phishing & social engineering** are the most common initial vectors.  
- **Insider threats** carry high risk due to trust and access.  
- **Supply chain** and **cloud misconfigs** are growing in both frequency and impact.  
- Pairing actor profiles with their likely vector helps you anticipate and defend.
