# Threat Actors & Attack Vectors — Domain 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations

Focus: Map key threat actor profiles to their typical breaching methods  
Purpose: Equip learners to link actor motivations and capabilities with real-world attack vectors

## Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups that intentionally exploit vulnerabilities. They vary by motivation, capability, resources and risk tolerance.

### Common Threat Actor Types

- **Script Kiddies**  
  Inexperienced attackers using readily available tools and exploits  
  Motivation: curiosity or reputation  
  Risk: low skill but can still cause damage via automated tools

- **Hacktivists**  
  Ideologically or politically motivated individuals or groups  
  Motivation: protest, attention or disruption

- **Organized Crime**  
  Well-funded criminal groups focused on financial gain  
  Methods: ransomware, phishing, extortion

- **Nation-State Actors (APTs)**  
  State-sponsored teams with advanced capabilities  
  Methods: zero-day exploits, long-term stealth campaigns

- **Insiders**  
  Employees, contractors or third parties with legitimate access  
  Types: malicious (intentional) or negligent (accidental)

- **Competitors**  
  External entities seeking trade secrets or aiming to sabotage operations

## Threat Actor Attributes

Actors can be further classified by:

- **Sophistication** – unskilled to advanced persistent threat  
- **Resources** – from hobbyist tools to custom malware and zero-days  
- **Motivation** – financial, ideological, competitive or state objectives  
- **Preferred Vectors** – chosen based on access level and goals

## Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are the paths or methods used to gain access to systems. They often exploit user behavior, technical vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

### Common Attack Vectors

- **Email / Phishing**  
  Malicious links or attachments that steal credentials or deliver malware

- **Social Engineering**  
  Pretexting, baiting, tailgating or impersonation to manipulate individuals

- **Removable Media**  
  USB drives or portable storage used to introduce malware or exfiltrate data

- **Wireless & Bluetooth**  
  Rogue access points, protocol exploits or weak encryption

- **Public-Facing Applications**  
  Web apps or APIs vulnerable to injection, misconfiguration or unpatched flaws

- **Supply Chain**  
  Compromised third-party hardware, software or updates

- **Cloud Services**  
  Misconfigured storage, weak credentials or missing multi-factor authentication

- **Drive-By Downloads**  
  Websites that automatically download malware when visited

- **Physical Access**  
  Direct access to devices or facilities to install rogue hardware or extract data

## Reinforcement Notes

- Most attacks begin with phishing or social engineering  
- Insiders pose high risk due to trust and access privileges  
- Supply chain and cloud misconfigurations are rising in frequency and impact  
- Pair threat actor profiles with likely vectors to anticipate and defend
