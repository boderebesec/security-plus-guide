# Scripting, Automation & Incident Response â€” Domain 4: Security Operations

Topic: Automation, Scripting, Incident Response, Digital Forensics  
Domain: 4.0 Security Operations

---

## Purpose of Security Operations

Security operations harness automation, scripting, and structured response processes to detect, contain, and recover from incidents faster, while maintaining forensic readiness.

---

## 1. Automation & Scripting

Automation streamlines repetitive or complex security tasks, increasing consistency and reducing human error

**Benefits**
- Efficiency: automate patching, alert triage, ticketing, and log reviews  
- Scalability: apply security controls rapidly across infrastructure  
- Consistency: eliminate configuration drift  

**Use Cases**
- Configuration management: Ansible, Puppet, Chef  
- Automated response: SOAR platforms  
- Scripted log parsing and alerting: Python, PowerShell, Bash  
- User provisioning/deprovisioning: integrate with IAM  

**Scripting Languages**

| Language     | Common Uses                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Python       | API calls, log parsing, automation scripts |
| PowerShell   | Windows automation, registry edits       |
| Bash         | Linux automation, cron jobs, log rotation |

## 2. Incident Response Lifecycle

Incident response ensures teams detect, contain, and recover from security incidents using a structured approach

**Phases (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)**
1. Preparation  
2. Detection & Analysis  
3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery  
4. Post-Incident Activities  

**Key Activities**
- Preparation: training, policy development, tool configuration  
- Detection & Analysis: SIEM alerts, IDS/IPS, log review  
- Containment: isolate affected systems  
- Eradication: remove malicious artifacts  
- Recovery: restore from backups, monitor environment  
- Post-Incident Activities: lessons learned, update playbooks

## 3. Digital Forensics

Digital forensics supports incident response with evidence preservation and analysis for legal and operational purposes

**Process**
- Identification & Collection: secure memory, disk images, logs  
- Preservation: hashing, chain of custody, imaging  
- Analysis: timeline reconstruction, artifact parsing, malware analysis  
- Reporting: document findings for stakeholders and legal review
