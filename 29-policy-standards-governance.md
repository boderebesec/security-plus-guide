## Purpose of Governance in Cybersecurity

Security governance ensures that policies, standards, and oversight align with business objectives, legal requirements, and industry best practices. It defines the framework for decision-making, risk acceptance, and compliance.

## 1. Governance Structure

**Policy Hierarchy**  
- **Policy:** Strategic intent (e.g., data classification, acceptable use)  
- **Standard:** Mandatory controls to meet policy requirements (e.g., password rules)  
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step processes (e.g., access provisioning)  
- **Guideline:** Recommended best practices (e.g., secure configurations)

**Common Frameworks**  
COBIT | NIST CSF | ISO/IEC 27001 | ITIL

| Role               | Responsibility                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Owner         | Defines data classification and usage policies    |
| Data Custodian     | Implements and maintains data protection controls |
| User               | Follows policies and reports security issues      |
| Auditor            | Validates compliance with policies and standards  |
| Security Officer   | Oversees governance program and policy enforcement|

## 3. Security Oversight

- **Policy Monitoring:** Verify ongoing compliance with policies and standards  
- **Change Management:** Control system changes through documented approvals
