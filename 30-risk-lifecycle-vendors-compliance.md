## Purpose of Risk Management & Compliance

Risk and compliance functions ensure that cybersecurity decisions align with legal, operational, and business risk appetites. These processes identify, evaluate, and treat risks while maintaining regulatory alignment across vendors and internal stakeholders.

## 1. Risk Lifecycle

The risk lifecycle provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk:

### Phases:
- **Identification**: Asset discovery, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment  
- **Assessment**: Qualitative or quantitative analysis of likelihood and impact  
- **Analysis**: Risk register creation, risk scoring (e.g., using CVSS)  
- **Treatment**: Avoidance, mitigation, transfer (e.g., insurance), or acceptance  
- **Monitoring**: Continuous oversight, periodic reassessment, risk dashboards  

### Related Terms:
- **Risk Appetite**: The level of risk the organization is willing to accept  
- **Risk Tolerance**: Acceptable variance from the risk appetite  
- **Residual Risk**: Risk that remains after controls are applied

## 2. Vendor & Third-Party Risk Management

Vendor relationships can expose an organization to privacy, compliance, and operational risks.

### Key Areas:
- **Due Diligence**: Background checks, compliance history, financial stability  
- **Security Assessments**: Questionnaires, penetration tests, security attestations  
- **Third-Party Agreements**: NDAs, SLAs, DPAs (Data Processing Agreements)  
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Vendor risk rating platforms, periodic audits  
- **Rules of Engagement**: Define authorized testing methods and contact boundaries

## 3. Compliance Requirements

Cybersecurity compliance aligns internal practices with external mandates.

### Common Frameworks:
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection  
- **GDPR**: Data subject rights and cross-border data rules  
- **SOX**: Financial reporting controls  
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card security  
- **FISMA**: U.S. federal information system management  

### Reporting & Accountability:
- **Attestation**: Formal assertion of compliance  
- **Internal Audits**: Validate controls and identify gaps  
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Fines, loss of trust, legal liability
