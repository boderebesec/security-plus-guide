## Purpose of Auditing and Awareness in Cybersecurity

Audits and user-focused controls ensure that cybersecurity programs are both verifiable and actionable. While technical controls are vital, human behavior often presents the highest risk. Auditing identifies gaps and ensures accountability; awareness programs empower users to mitigate threats like phishing.

## 1. Audits and Assessments

**Internal and External Audits**
- Internal: Conducted by internal teams to ensure policy and process alignment.
- External: Performed by third parties for compliance (e.g., SOC 2, PCI-DSS).

**Audit Types**
- Operational: Processes and controls  
- Technical: Security configurations and vulnerabilities  
- Administrative: Policy enforcement and documentation  

**Audit Concepts**
- Attestation: Third-party verification of compliance  
- Evidence: Logs, tickets, access reports, change control  
- Findings & Remediation: Audit reports and mitigation plans

## 2. Phishing and Social Engineering Threats

Phishing remains a top threat vector and includes various forms of deception.

**Types of Phishing**
- Email Phishing: Spoofed messages with malicious links or attachments  
- Spear Phishing: Targeted attacks on specific individuals or roles  
- Smishing: SMS-based phishing  
- Vishing: Voice phishing  
- Pretexting & Impersonation: Use of authority or fake scenarios  

**Indicators of Phishing**
- Suspicious links or domains  
- Urgent or threatening language  
- Unexpected attachments  
- Mismatched sender and reply-to addresses

## 3. Security Awareness Training

**Goals of Awareness Programs**
- Recognize and report phishing  
- Understand secure practices (passwords, device use, remote work)  
- Reinforce compliance with policies  

**Program Elements**
- Ongoing training campaigns  
- Simulated phishing attacks  
- Policy acknowledgment and sign-off  
- Role-specific content for high-risk departments  

**Behavior Monitoring**
- Track clicks on phishing simulations  
- Measure incident reporting rates  
- Align behavior with acceptable use policies
